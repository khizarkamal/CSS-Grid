Yes, you are correct! Here's a breakdown of how auto-fit works:

Adding Columns:

When using auto-fit in the grid-template-columns property, the grid attempts to fit as many columns as possible within the container.
If there is enough space available to add another column that meets the specified minimum width (e.g., minmax(100px, 1fr)), the grid will create a new column.
Handling Extra Space:

If there's not enough space to add a new column that meets the minimum width requirement, auto-fit won't create an additional column.
Instead, the extra space is distributed among the existing columns in that row, allowing them to expand up to their maximum width (defined by the 1fr in minmax(100px, 1fr)).
In summary, auto-fit ensures that grid items only take up the necessary space, and any leftover space is evenly distributed among the existing columns, making it a great choice for responsive design.
